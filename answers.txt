    "merge commit" will not be present in fast forward merge.
•  Why should you have different branches? 
    Since all our teammates will be working on different parts of the project and sometimes be changing a common file, creating seperate branch will help in keeping track of what are the 
    new changes and what are the old changes and decide on which one to accept in case of merge conflicts.
